Most items in our bathrooms are made of ceramic, i.e. the sink, and the toilet. Ceramic is a pretty material that is relatively easy to keep clean, and it has a robust, hygienic, shining appeal. The material is quite vulnerable, think of black or gray stripes that appear inside of a sink. Another common damage type is the scratch or tear.

## Refinishing enamel

enamel is a material that is still used for bathrooms. There are still steel tubs for sale which have a coating of enamel. enamel is a layer of molten glass that’s used to cover the steel. The main advantage is the endurance of the material and the fact that the coating is anti-scratch. These advantages come with a more expensive price tag. Dropping a heavy object onto a enamel tub could cause it to chip.

## Refinishing acrylic

Acrylic is another commonly used material for tubs. The advantages over enamel is its pricing and damaged acrylic is easier to repair.
The most common damage to an acrylic tub is scratches.
