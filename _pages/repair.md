## Bring that old, broken tub back to life

The bathtub is often a costly part of the residence. A small accident can cause major damage. Replacing a bathtub conventionally is paired with a lot of ruckus. Let alone the costs and consequential damages that comes with it.

That is why repairing instead of replacing is the best alternative. The costs are only a fraction compared to an entire renovation and the job can be completed in just a couple of hours.

The repairs we do cover tears, scratches and or holes in:

+ Bathtubs and shower made out of acrylic, quaryl and emaille
+ Steam cabins
+ Hot tubs and spa baths
+ Ceramic sinks
+ Floor- and wall tiles
